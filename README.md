# GameHubGit

Still a work in progress.
Designwise, all done, so now its code and functionality that remains.

I have pr november 8. 2022 only put in image placeholders in the psn-grid.html, product_details_ps5-forge-legend-disc.html, cart.html & wishlist.html.
Will be using the rest of the time available before CA deadline to convert them to CSS grids. Thats the plan anyways.
So hopefully there is enough time to make everything happen in time.
